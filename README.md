# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Kaggle Project
Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn
1. Initially the dataset was preprocessed and then analyzed, visualized the data. An Unsupervised Learning approach is used for this project.
2. Anomaly Detection method like Local Outlier Factor from the Sklearn package and the Isolation Force Algorithm is used to calculate the Anomaly scores.
3. An accuracy of 99% was achieved for both Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Force Algorithm, but Isolation Force had a better precision rate.
